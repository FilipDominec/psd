# Power spectral density computation

Computes PSD function of a given 2D-data file. The formats supported are highly specific - I do this for our lab so it accepts SEM images and Horiba spectrometer's mapping. 

If you wish to adapt this script to your needs, feel free to contact me - file a new issue for this project.
